# Lost
Lost is a 2D platformer game I created for a university project.
It is programmed with C++, Allegro 5, and Mappy. I'm going to 
continue to expand Lost beyond the original project's
requirements. Lost will work with Windows 10 and above.

To install, download the msi and exe files.
Double-click on the exe file.

To have access to the source files and/or if you have any
questions or notice any errors,
